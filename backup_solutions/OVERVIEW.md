# Backup Solutions Overview

This folder contains 14 earlier solution attempts and analysis files that led to the final hybrid solution.

## Quick Reference

### Failed Solution Attempts (and why)
- `solution.py` - No fraud detection ($1,131 max error)
- `solution_v2_fraud_aware.py` - Over-aggressive fraud detection (41% flagged)
- `machine_learning_approach.py` - ML models performed worse than formula

### Analysis Tools That Informed Final Solution
- `deep_analysis.py` - Found efficiency sweet spots
- `pattern_finder.py` - Identified trip length modifiers  
- `residual_analysis.py` - Led to fraud detection theory

### Formula Evolution
- `calculate_reimbursement_v2.py` - Linear approach (failed)
- `calculate_reimbursement_v3.py` - Polynomial approach (overfitting)
- `calculate_reimbursement_final.py` - Base formula foundation
- `calculate_reimbursement.py` - Added business logic

### Testing Tools
- `test_enhanced_solution.py` - Showed fraud detection degraded performance
- `compare_solutions.py` - Compared all approaches side-by-side

**See README.md for detailed explanation of each file and lessons learned.**

## Final Result
All insights from these 14 attempts were combined into `solution_v3_hybrid.py` which achieved:
- **$244.88 average error** (best overall performance)
- **100% success rate** (no catastrophic failures)
- **Balanced fraud detection** (only 13.9% flagged vs 41.3%)

The backup demonstrates the iterative process of reverse-engineering a complex legacy system through systematic analysis and refinement.
