# V6 - Systematic Corrections Approach

## Approach
- Mathematical formula with systematic corrections based on residual analysis
- Base formula: `days*90 + miles*0.4 + sqrt(receipts)*15`
- Applied duration-specific and receipt-specific corrections
- Achieved score: **14414.00** (avg error $143.14)

- `per_diem_analysis.py` - Per-diem rate analysis
- `debug_cases.py` - Case-by-case debugging

## Key Insights
- Discovered better coefficients through systematic analysis
- Applied additive corrections instead of multiplicative modifiers
- Identified systematic biases in duration and receipt processing

## Performance
- **Best mathematical approach** achieved so far
- Significant improvement from pure mathematical optimization
